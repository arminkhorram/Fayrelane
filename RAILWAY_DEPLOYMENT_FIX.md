# Railway Deployment Fix - Fayrelane.com

## 🔍 **Problem Diagnosed**

The "Not Found" error on https://fayrelane.com was caused by:

1. **Mismatched build directories**: Server was looking for `client/dist` but Next.js builds to `client/out` (static export) or `client/.next`
2. **Incorrect Next.js configuration**: Static export was disabled, breaking the build process
3. **Server static file serving**: Not properly configured for Next.js static export

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Updated Next.js Configuration** (`client/next.config.js`)
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
    // Enable static export for Railway deployment
    output: 'export',
    trailingSlash: true,
    distDir: 'out',
    
    images: {
        unoptimized: true, // Required for static export
        // ... other config
    }
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Server Static File Serving** (`server/index.js`)
- Now serves from `client/out` directory (Next.js static export)
- Properly handles client-side routing
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. **Updated Build Process** (`nixpacks.toml`)
- Improved build commands
- Added build verification steps
- Better error reporting

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. **Push changes** to your repository
2. **Railway will automatically rebuild** with the new configuration
3. **Monitor the build logs** for any errors

### Step 2: Verify Build Process
Check Railway build logs for:
```
🏗️  Building Next.js client application...
✅ Client build complete!
📁 Checking build output...
```

### Step 3: Test Endpoints
After deployment, test these URLs:

1. **Health Check**: `https://fayrelane.com/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","uptime":123,"timestamp":"..."}`

2. **Homepage**: `https://fayrelane.com/`
   - Should show the Fayrelane homepage

3. **API Routes**: `https://fayrelane.com/api/auth/register`
   - Should return API responses (not 404)

## 🔧 **Environment Variables Required**

Make sure these are set in Railway:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://fayrelane.com
```

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### After Deployment:
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/` shows homepage (not "Not Found")
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/health` returns 200 OK
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/listings` shows listings page
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/categories` shows categories page
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/sell` shows sell page
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/register` shows registration form
- [ ] `https://fayrelane.com/login` shows login form
- [ ] Navigation links work correctly
- [ ] "Get Started Free" button works

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### If still getting "Not Found":

1. **Check Railway logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for these messages:
   ✅ Static export directory found
   ✅ Static file serving configured for Next.js export
   ```

2. **Verify build output**:
   ```bash
   # Should see:
   📁 Looking for static files at: /app/client/out
   📄 Looking for index file at: /app/client/out/index.html
   ```

3. **Check environment variables**:
   - `NODE_ENV=production` must be set
   - `DATABASE_URL` should be configured
   - `JWT_SECRET` should be set

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Static export not found"
**Solution**: Check that `npm run build` completed successfully in client directory

**Issue**: "API route not found" for frontend routes
**Solution**: Verify the catch-all route `app.get('*', ...)` is working

**Issue**: CSS/JS files not loading
**Solution**: Check that static files are being served from `/client/out`

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

1. **Homepage loads**: https://fayrelane.com/ shows the Fayrelane homepage
2. **Navigation works**: All links (Browse, Categories, Sell, etc.) work correctly
3. **API endpoints work**: Backend API is accessible at `/api/*` routes
4. **Static assets load**: CSS, JS, and images load properly
5. **Client-side routing**: Navigation between pages works smoothly

## 📋 **Post-Deployment Verification**

Run these tests:

```bash
# Test homepage
curl -I https://fayrelane.com/

# Test health endpoint
curl https://fayrelane.com/health

# Test API endpoint
curl https://fayrelane.com/api/auth/register

# Test static files
curl -I https://fayrelane.com/_next/static/css/app.css
```

All should return 200 OK (except the API endpoint which may return 400/405 for GET requests, which is normal).

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

✅ **Homepage loads correctly**
✅ **Navigation links work**
✅ **No console errors**
✅ **Static assets load**
✅ **API endpoints respond**
✅ **Health check passes**

The deployment should now work correctly! 🚀
