## ✅ Verification Results

### **1. Server Status**

```
Process ID: 10368
Status: Running
Port: 5000
Start Time: October 12, 2025 9:06:03 PM
```

**✅ Server started successfully**

---

### **2. Health Endpoint Test**

**Request:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "uptime": 33,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-13T02:06:38.548Z"
}
```

**Status Code:** `200 OK` ✅

**✅ Health endpoint working correctly**

---

### **3. AWS SDK v2 Warning Check**

**Expected Warning (if v2 was still present):**
```
(node:1) NOTE: The AWS SDK for JavaScript (v2) is in maintenance mode.
SDK releases are limited to address critical bug fixes and security issues only.
Please migrate your code to use AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3).
```

**Actual Result:**
```
✅ NO AWS SDK v2 WARNINGS DETECTED
```

The server started cleanly without any deprecation warnings, confirming the migration to AWS SDK v3 was successful.

---

### **4. Code Verification**

**✅ AWS SDK v3 Package Installed:**
```bash
@aws-sdk/client-s3: ^3.637.0 (installed in node_modules)
```

**✅ AWS SDK v2 Package Removed:**
```bash
aws-sdk: (not found in package.json or node_modules)
```

**✅ Code Updated:**
- `server/routes/listings.js`: Using S3Client and PutObjectCommand
- Import: `const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3')`
- Client: `new S3Client({ region, credentials })`
- Upload: `await s3Client.send(new PutObjectCommand(params))`
